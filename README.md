# FS2020 Liveries
 Collection of liveries for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

### Please note
This is still a work in progress as we work out livery issues. Feel free to contribute and add more liveries.
Just make sure they are clean and adhere to the guide here: https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/how-to-creating-custom-liveries-with-ps-or-other-image-editor/153027

More detailed instructions and resources will be added shortly. Please be patient.
