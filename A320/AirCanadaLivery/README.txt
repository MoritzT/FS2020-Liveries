1. You need to have the Livery Basepack installed


2. Copy the TEXTURE.XXX (xxx is any airline code eg DLH, BAW, AAL) folder to your Basepack Airplanes directory where the other liveries are located
	"Community\..\Liveries\SimObjects\Airplanes\"


3. Insert the lines from LAYOUT_JSON_LINES.txt into your layout.json (located in the main directory) - note do not replace, add these new entries, if you are unaware how to, just look at the entries in the json file to get an understanding, commas are very important!


4. Copy the entry in AIRCRAFT_CFG_LINES.txt to your Aircraft.cfg located in
	"Community\..\Liveries\SimObjects\Airplanes\"

	NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE [FLTSIM.XX] AND CHANGE IT TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE NUMBER E.G. [FLTSIM.9]
